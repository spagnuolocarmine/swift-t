== Introduction

This tutorial aims at 

Two Flavors of Swift: K and T..

Both are installed and available for use on ALCF systems..

== Choosing between K and T

Use Swift/T if:

- your tasks are short (seconds to subseconds)
- your workflow fits well into a single scheduler (e.g., PBS) job
- you can optionally link your application code against the Swift/T framework.

Use Swift/K if:

- your apps are longer-running (minutes to hours)
- your apps are complex executables that can not be readily linked into Swift/T
- your workflows have time-varying resource demands
- It is advantageous to break your resource requests into multiple smaller jobs
