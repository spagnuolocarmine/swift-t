lb is a distributed MPI-based load balancer and data-store.

lb depends on:
 * c-utils, for data structures and other utilities

lb is being developed as part of the Swift-T project.

The lb source code was originally derived from ADLB-M. For further

Building
========
To build lb:

    ./setup.sh
    export CC=mpicc
    ./configure --with-c-utils=<PATH/TO/CUTILS> \
                --prefix=<INSTALL/PATH>
    make
    make install

Advanced configuration
----------------------
To enable MPE debugging:
    --with-mpe=</PATH/TO/MPE/DIR>

To enable ADLB debug logging:
    --enable-log-debug

To disable logging and enable optimizations:
    --enable-fast

To enable checkpointing functionality (requires zlib):
    --enable-checkpoint

Environment variables
---------------------
To enable performance counters (printed at end of execution):
    ADLB_PERF_COUNTERS=true

To print overall execution time:
    ADLB_PRINT_TIME=true

To print unfreed data at end of execution:
    ADLB_REPORT_LEAKS=true

To print DEBUG/TRACE level information (if compiled with it enabled):
    ADLB_TRACE=true
    ADLB_DEBUG=true
