== Overview

This page has information regarding the current and historical Swift/T
releases.

Swift/T consists of multiple components which have their own version
numbers.  The release numbers are formatted as +major.minor.bugfix+.

Swift/T will make feature releases on a monthly basis, which increment
the +minor+ version number.

made available to certain users as necessary.
