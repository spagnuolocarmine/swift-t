Swift/T Help

swift-t <options> <program.swift>
Compiles program.swift with STC and runs it with Turbine

Swift/T Web Site: http://swift-lang.org/Swift-T

You may provide STC and/or Turbine options.
When there is a conflict, STC takes precedence.
Use swift-t -t to pass arguments through to Turbine.
For example, to provide an MPICH hosts file, use:
swift-t -t f:hosts.txt program.swift
