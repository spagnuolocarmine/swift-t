Steps to run the coaster tests
==============================

1. Get Coaster client tcl package
----------------------------------
mkdir swift-devel
cd swift-devel
svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/cogkit/svn/trunk/src/cog
cd cog/modules
svn co https://svn.ci.uchicago.edu/svn/vdl2/trunk swift
cd swift
ant redist
cd ../provider-coaster-c-client/
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-swig --with-tcl-version=8.5 --with-tcl=<PATH_TO_TCL>
make

Now, the tcl folder contains the tcl packages necessary for loading
the coaster client package.

Use  export TCLLIBPATH=<PWD>/tcl

2. Start a coaster service
---------------------------

cd cog/modules/provider-coaster-c-client/tests/coasters
start-coaster-service

The coaster service is configured using the coaster-service.conf file.
The configurations that go into that file, is beyond the scope of this
README. The current configuration is set for the service to run on
thrash.mcs.anl.gov with a worker each on crush.mcs.anl.gov and
grind.mcs.anl.gov. The service port is 53001, and the SwiftT code is not
hardcoded to use that particular port as of 11/8/2013.

You can stop a running coaster-service using stop-coaster-service.


3. Run SwiftT leaf apps through coasters
----------------------------------------

Get SwiftT sources. Compile (details beyond scope) the turbine sources
in exm-trunk/sfw/turbine/branches/issue-503/code.

There are tests that you can run in exm-trunk/sfw/turbine/branches/issue-503/code/tests/coasters.

There is a run-test.sh script there which does the job of adding the
TCLLIBPATH to the right path settings for turbine and runs the specified
SwiftT program.
